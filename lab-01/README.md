# Lab 02 - Minikube

For these labs we will use minikube as our Kubernetes environment. This is
going to run locally on your host.

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a 
single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to 
try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

## Task 1: Installing minikube

The easiest way to install minikube is with [https://brew.sh/](homebrew). The 
following command will install minikube.

```
brew cask install minikube
```

## Task 2: Confirming minikube installation

To verify that the installation is succesfull we can try to get the version of
minikube with the following command :

```
minikube version

minikube version: v0.35.0
```

## Task 3: Running minikube

To start minikube run the following command (it might take a couple of minutes 
before minikube has started):

```
😄  minikube v0.35.0 on darwin (amd64)
💡  Tip: Use 'minikube start -p <name>' to create a new cluster, or 'minikube delete' to delete this one.

## Task 4: Checking minikube status

To verify that minikube is running correctly run the `minikube status` command:

```
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubectl: Correctly Configured: pointing to minikube-vm at 192.168.99.102
